Due 26 Feb, 2014  Introduction to Data Science - GAJournal Review\:  'Elements of Optimal Predictive Modeling Success in Data Science: An Analysis of Survey Data for the ‘Give me some credit’ competition hosted on Kaggle'This journal paper was written based on a Kaggle competition, ‘Give me some credit’, held between Sept 2011 and Dec 2011. And the paper is on the analysis of a survey of the contestants, making sense of the most important factors which led to the success of the winning teams. In a sense, it is a “meta-analysis” – analysis on the group of data scientist who participated in the analysis competition. As expected, the paper drew conclusions based on the competition results; however, there is a sense of over-reliance on the Kaggle competition as some of the conclusion could be drawn from the competition results alone, and was not insights from the analysis.Methodologies used as part of the paper were mostly simple descriptive statistics and various data visualization methods, such as line charts, scatter charts, text cloud, correlation pies, etc. A simple linear regression model was applied for the final conclusion of the paper.Despite the lack of academic rigor, this paper, however, is a good introduction to deeper level of understanding for one of the most popular Kaggle competition at the time. The topic and conclusion were also interesting; along with detailed data visualizations (graphs of data), R codes, and competition winner survey results. Based on the introductory nature of the paper, I believe the author’s succeeded in his aim of raising awareness of the competition and its implication, in addition to the winners.As a student of Data Science, I believe we intuitively understand what makes a good Data Scientist. The paper listed out its original determinants: “Optimal Model”, “Effort”, “Predictive Modeling skill”, “Hard work”, “domain knowledge”, “team work”. The paper concluded that the best determining factor of getting the best predictive model is the choice of model(s) used. Other factors such as education and experience were not a good predictive factor in modeling success.Furthermore, the paper also concluded that credit scoring was indeed a commodity – proprietary models done by PhDs with a lot more data barely did better than an open-source ‘Random Forest’ algorithm, and only did 0.1% better than the winners of the competition. This conclusion indeed supported the competition sponsors objectives.
